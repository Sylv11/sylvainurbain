Very quickly, he shows shows interest in the art of folding paper, origami, or for basketball.\n\nSylvain's primary and secondary studies (2010 - 2016) took place at Saint-Ferdinand in Jemappes. He manages to stand out and gets prizes at the end of each cycle. It is at the end of his humanities that he discovers an interest in programming thanks to his 'Science - Computer Science' option. It turns out that this branch fits with his logical mind.\n\nAnxious to continue in this fascinating field, he then began higher studies at the Haute Ecole en Hainaut in Mons for a professional Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Systems orientation networks & telecommunications with development option (2016). The thirst for learning and progress in this vast area is one of the driving forces like his sport, which he practices at the same time as bodybuilding.\n\nCurrently (2018), Sylvain is in the final year of Bachelor."
