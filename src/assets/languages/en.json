            "text": "I was born on 23 December 1998 in Mons. During my childhood, I showed an interest in paper folding: origami. Also, a passion for basketball developed and pushed me to join a club and play for 2 years.\n\nI completed my primary and secondary school studies (2010 - 2016) at the Institut Saint-Ferdinand and managed to win prizes at the end of each cycle. It is at the end of my humanities that I discovered an interest in programming thanks to my option 'Science - Computer Science'. Indeed, this rewarding field corresponds with my logical mind.\n\nAnxious to continue in this branch, I start, in 2016, higher studies at the Haute Ã‰cole en Hainaut in Mons in order to validate my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Systems, orientation networks & telecommunications with option development. The thirst for learning and progress in this vast field is one of the driving forces that motivate me, just like the sport I practiced at that time: bodybuilding.\n\nAt the end of my studies and a traineeship at the European Commission, I graduated in June 2019 with great distinction and the congratulations of the jury for my graduation work. At that time, a position as Software Developer at Emixis, a company based in Brussels, was already assured to me by a contract signed some time before.\n\nSo I started my career in July 2019. I am still working at Emixis with a Professional Scrum Developer certification."
